    /*
     * Three forms of user defined types
     * -Enums:
     *      The simplest of the user-defined types. The values
            that an enumeration can take are restricted to a set of possible values.
            Enumerations are excellent for modeling categorical concepts.
     * -Classes:
     *      More fully featured types that give you flexibility to pair data
            and functions. Classes that only contain data are called plain-old-data
            classes; youâ€™ll learn about them in this section.
     * -Unions:
     *      A boutique user-defined type. All members share the same
            memory location. Unions are dangerous and easy to misuse.
